We have created a program that allows the user to find and analyze songs. In some instances, you may hear a song but only remember a sentence/ word of it. This code allows you to find that said song based on the word you remember and get various information about it.

The program works in the following way:
1. the user is asked to search for keywords
2. We use a spotify database to search for songs that match these keywords and display a maximum of 15 songs with their album titles and artist names
3. Users are asked to give the number of the song they want the analysis for
4. For the chosen song, we give a popularity rating, a sentiment analysis (negative or positive), links to a 30 seconds extract, link to the spotify album page, audio features such as danceability, and tempo and we print the lyrics in English
